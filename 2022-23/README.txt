ControllerTesting.java
----------------------------
This is the code we used in order to code the controller.

This code includes wheel driving, arm movement for the arm we used, a programmed servo called chopsticks that we used to grab the cones.

Driving uses functions at the bottom of the code, all other code is above in the file and commented

Images on the robot we used is provided in the folder

----------------------------
This code was made with blocks and is used for our auto.

It involves working vulfora image recognition using a webcam (must be plugged into robot, not driver hub) 

It also includes our auto, this was made using movement functions that can be found on the right side of the block

The right side of the block also includes the needed functions and code for vulfora to work, it is recommended that you research this code.

Alongside this, the top part of the main block is used for camera recognition, and the lower part is used for the auto

Issues:

Cannot convert to java, when converted, vulfora will not run as needed, current fix is unknown.
